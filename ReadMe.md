## 🎯 How to Play

* Words appear on the screen attached to enemies.
* Start typing:

   -  The first correct key locks onto a word.
    
    - Keep typing until the word is completed.
    
    - The enemy is destroyed when the word is finished.
* If an enemy reaches you before you finish typing, you lose a life.
* The game ends when you lose all lives.
